<h2>About me:</h2>
<main>
<p ID="p1">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.a&shy;
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, a&shy;
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.a&shy;
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,a&shy;
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets a&shy;
containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
